# calculator
The goal for this assignment was to design a straight-forward calculator using Verilog,which would later be implemented on a Nexys-4 board which utilises a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA.
A very crude verification was also done using Verilog. The verification is described as crude because it is using non-randomised unit testing. 
The RTL was determined after fully understanding the specification of the assignment given, and then was realised through Verilog.
